# Arduino-ultrasonic-senor-servo-motor
This project uses an Arduino UNO, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor to demonstrate automated control based on distance measurement. The servo motor moves according to the readings from the ultrasonic sensor, which can be used as a foundation for applications like automatic parking systems or obstacle detection in robotics
